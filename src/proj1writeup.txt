=== Project 1 Test Cases Writeup ===

Note that currently letters are handled a bit weird, it will tokenize the beginning of a keyword (which we DEFINITELY DO NOT want). I am working on a solution to this.

test.txt:
Lexes properly. Note that strings take priority over comments in my lexer, so it will instantly gloss over the
comments contained in the '' quotes. Will throw an end comment warning since there's a lone end comment token detected,
as well as an invalid char type in string (for the ! mark), both of which are expected.
Last line returns absolutely nothing in its output and throws a fatal error intentionally. No, I didn't forget the $ sign.

testCases.txt:
First few lines are fairly standard, basic comment stuff. Line 4 will throw an invalid token error for that @ symbol hiding in there, but otherwise is normal.
Intentional blank space after it to test whitespace errors, which is consolidated into program 5. Note that it's not an error for leaving the line blank, but is still
not something we really want to do a lot.
The line after is where it gets fun - a big ol' BoolOp chunk for us to process, which luckily we can parse through and figure out that it's just way too big and space-less to 
do anything with. Throw a bunch of warnings here and move on (also note the comment end token at the beginning, which is conveniently handled!).
Last line has another big ol' boolean(tm). Like usual, see what works and what doesn't. This was an absolute pain to figure out, but at least I get some dopamine
from seeing the bajillions of "BoolOp Statement Out of Bounds" warnings pop up in my console. Also include a sneaky comment end glued to the EOP token for one final test.

Copy-paste of the example code in the project document. It works. that's about it.
