**INSTALLATION:**
1. Navigate to the "src" folder using your handy command shell (Windows key + R and type "cmd"). type "cd" and then drag the folder into the command shell. This will load the directory for you.
2. Compile the goodies by typing "javac Compiler.java" - make sure it's javac and not java for this one.
3. Now you can actually run some stuff, so type in "java Compiler.java" followed up by whatever file we want to test (including the extension).

That's it, enjoy!
