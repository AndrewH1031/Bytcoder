# cmpt432-compilers
A repository for my compiler code for cmpt432, taught by Alan Labouseur.

For this project I'll either be using Java, Typescript or C++... check back on this in a week and I'll give you a clear answer.
For now, though, I've done the usual Hello World stuff (written in Java, again this may be temporary) to check our compiler functionality.

HOW TO ACTUALLY MAKE ALL OF THIS FANCY LOOKING STUFF WORK (assuming you already have this downloaded):
1. Navigate to the folder containing the source files using your handy command shell (Windows key + R and type "cmd" for those uninitiated)
2. Compile the goodies by typing "javac Compiler.java" - make sure it's javac and not java for this one
3. Now you can actually run some stuff, so type in "java Compiler.java". We might tweak this a bit later if it's needed to access project files, though, so stay alert.

That's it for now.
