# cmpt432-compilers
A repository for my compiler code for cmpt432, taught by Alan Labouseur.

For this project I'll be using Java, which is a wonderful programming language that has absolutely no flaws whatsoever.

HOW TO ACTUALLY MAKE ALL OF THIS FANCY LOOKING STUFF WORK (assuming you already have this downloaded):
1. Navigate to the folder containing the "src" folder using your handy command shell (Windows key + R and type "cmd" for those uninitiated)
2. Compile the goodies by typing "javac Compiler.java" - make sure it's javac and not java for this one
3. Now you can actually run some stuff, so type in "java Compiler.java" followed up by whatever file we want to test. We might tweak this a bit later if it's needed to access project files, though, so stay alert.

That's it for now.
